In the following prototype, we are going to base our work on an existing GitHub project by Abdullah Tarek (https://github.com/abdullahtarek/football_analysis
). This project analyzes clips of football games, tracking players, referees, and the ball from a .mp4 video, by leveraging the YOLO AI object detection model. Our prototype version will be available at https://github.com/AbdelHamdyGhanem/football_analysis
. In the project, we will add an interactive betting dashboard with an expandable sidebar to manage betting options, amounts, and confirmations; a notification system to show real match events and their probability of occurring; player data (names and ratings); mouse-based dashboard controls; and the ability to pause and resume the game (mainly for testing). The original repository contains modules for object detection using YOLO, clustering with K-means to detect t-shirt colors, optical flow to calculate camera motion, perspective transformation to show depth in the scene, and calculation of player speed and distance.
